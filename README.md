## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
sections/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ video-banner.liquid    # Main section file with Liquid, CSS, and Schema
```

### Code Architecture

The section consists of three main components:

1. **CSS Styles**: Embedded styles for layout, responsiveness, and animations
2. **HTML Structure**: Liquid template with video element and overlay content
3. **Schema Configuration**: JSON schema defining all customizable settings

### üì± Responsive Design

The section automatically adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full viewport height (100vh) with large typography
- **Mobile**: Reduced height (70vh) with scaled-down text and logo sizes

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Common Issues and Solutions

#### Liquid Syntax Error: Unexpected character +

**Problem**: Shopify Liquid doesn't support the `+` operator for string concatenation.

```liquid
<!-- ‚ùå This causes an error -->
{{ section.settings.logo | img_url: section.settings.logo_width + 'x' }}
```

**Solution**: Use a fixed image size with CSS for scaling:

```liquid
<!-- ‚úÖ This works correctly -->
{{ section.settings.logo | img_url: '400x' }}
<!-- Control size with CSS -->
style="max-width: {{ section.settings.logo_width }}px;"
```

**Why this happens**: Shopify Liquid uses different syntax than JavaScript. For string concatenation, use the `append` or `prepend` filters instead of `+`.

#### üé• Video Not Playing
- Ensure the video file is uploaded to Shopify Files
- Check that the video URL is correct and accessible
- Verify the video is in MP4 format for best browser compatibility
- Modern browsers require user interaction for autoplay with sound (this section uses muted autoplay)

#### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- Keep video files under 10MB for optimal loading
- Use poster images to improve perceived loading speed
- Consider using different video formats for different devices

## üåê Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Support | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Chrome | ‚úÖ Full | Autoplay supported |
| Firefox | ‚úÖ Full | Autoplay supported |
| Safari | ‚úÖ Full | Autoplay supported |
| Edge | ‚úÖ Full | Autoplay supported |
| Mobile Browsers | ‚úÖ Full | Uses `playsinline` attribute |
| Older Browsers | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Graceful fallback to poster image |
